The [MIT/Wellesley Scheller Teacher Education Program](http://education.mit.edu/classes/overview) (STEP) prepares MIT and Wellesley College students to become teachers who are:

*   Able to bridge the boundaries among disciplines.
*   Eager to help students develop the desire to question and explore that is so much a part of the MIT experience.
*   Qualify for an initial license to teach in Massachusetts.

Main Activities

*   Observe and interview two experienced instructors at your school who teach heterogeneously grouped classes.
