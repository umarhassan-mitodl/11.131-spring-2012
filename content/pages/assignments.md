and "Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls" class presentations

_In the Real Boys presentation, the females in the class read the book and 'teach' content to the males in the class using a variety of teaching techniques. The males then respond to the presentation, discussing what they identified most with, what they disagreed with, etc._

_In the Reviving Ophelia presentation, the males in the class read the book and 'teach' content to the females in the class using a variety of teaching techniques, and the females respond._

_The intent beyond teaching techniques is that the teachers get a deeper understanding of the opposite sex's adolescent thinking and emotions._
